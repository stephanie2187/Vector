# Vector:
Created the Vector class to learn how dynamic arrays are implemented, without using ArrayLists in the solution. Used a Java interface, called SimpleList here, to specify which methods the class implements. The Vector file defines the class that implements the dynamic array, and it implements the SimpleList interface. 

# Built With:
